# README

## First project with Ruby on Rails

Working through the documentation on line
<https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html>

Tinkering a little also as I go.

## Update - why I stopped wasting my time with Rails

Everything was fine, code was fine, the problem between ruby versions and gems which seem to change themselves was just too time consuming. I ended up wasting about 2 days just trying to research and get the ruby/rails/gem/bundler apps all working in synch. I managed to get it working then the next day it broke again and bundler stopped working. There's not much point me having to uninstall and re-install all the applications every time I want to run the code.

Django is so much easier and works straight out of the box.

Will have to come back to this later when I have someone that can waste a lot of time with me on this as I can't justify the time lost Just trying to make this work.
